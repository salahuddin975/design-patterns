'''
- The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It involves creating 
a wrapper (the adapter) that converts one interface into another. In Python, you can implement the Adapter Pattern easily due to the language's flexibility. 

- In this Python example: LegacyComponent is an existing class with an incompatible interface, and it has a method legacy_operation.

- NewInterface is the new interface that the client code expects, and it has a method new_operation.

- Adapter is the adapter class that inherits from the NewInterface. It contains an instance of LegacyComponent and adapts it to work with the NewInterface.

- In the main function, we create an instance of LegacyComponent, then create an instance of the Adapter and pass the LegacyComponent instance to it. 
Finally, we call the new_operation method of the adapter, which in turn invokes the legacy_operation of the LegacyComponent.

- The Adapter Pattern in Python allows you to use existing classes with different interfaces in your code without modifying the original classes. 
This can be especially useful when working with libraries or legacy code.
